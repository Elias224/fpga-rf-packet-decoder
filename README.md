# fpga-rf-packet-decoder
FPGA Verilog project to decode real-world 433 MHz RF packets in real time.

# FPGA-Based 433 MHz Wireless Packet Decoder

This project decodes 433.920 MHz RF signals from wireless remotes in real-time using Verilog on a Nexys A7 FPGA.  
The RF pulse train is captured by a receiver module and decoded by a finite state machine (FSM), then output over UART to a terminal.

# FPGA 433 MHz Wireless Packet Decoder

This project uses a Nexys A7 FPGA to decode 433.920 MHz wireless remote signals in real-time.  
A simple RF receiver module (RXB6) captures the pulses, which are processed by a Verilog finite state machine.  
Decoded data is sent to a PC over UART and displayed live in a terminal window (PuTTY).

## System Overview

![System Diagram](doc/system_block_diagram.png)

- **Remote Control** sends OOK (on-off keying) pulses at 433 MHz.
- **RXB6 Module** picks up the RF pulses.
- **Nexys A7 FPGA** measures pulse widths and decodes them with a custom FSM.
- **UART Transmitter** sends decoded bits to a PC terminal over USB.

## Why This Project

I wanted a hands-on way to practice both RF signal processing and FPGA design.  
This project combines radio protocol analysis, real-time signal decoding, Verilog development, and embedded system communication ‚Äî all in one pipeline.
